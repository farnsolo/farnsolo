**Aspiring Computer Scientist and Software Developer**

I'm an computer science student, my interests include network programming, embedded systems, robotics, neuromorphic computers and Edge AI. My projects are built from a single concept/idea, and are expanded upon throughout development. I take care to constantly design solutions, test them and implement where fit.
